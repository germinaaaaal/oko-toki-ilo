toki pona as a computer-readable language

# toki pona is a goal for me
I am currently starting to learn toki pona. I plan on becoming quite well acquainted with the language as I think it has a lot to bring to my work as a hobby conlanger and aspiring linguist.

# toki pona is readable by machines.
toki pona is in my opinion the most valid candidate for an essential international auxiliary language, and I think it'll be interesting to make a program capable of processing and translating toki pona. cheers,
